# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a personal website showcase for displaying a character reference sheet with interactive color mapping. Visitors can explore the character design by hovering over different areas to see detailed color information including hex codes, RGB, and HSL values. The application will be built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to provide a professional presentation of the character artwork.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to display my character reference sheet prominently, so that visitors can see my character design clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor loads the website THEN the system SHALL display the character reference sheet as the main focal point
2. WHEN the reference sheet loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the original image quality and aspect ratio
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL center the reference sheet appropriately on the screen
4. WHEN the image is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure it fits well within the viewport on different screen sizes
5. WHEN the reference sheet is shown THEN the system SHALL include a subtle indication that it's interactive

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to pre-define interactive color segments on my reference sheet, so that visitors can discover the specific colors used in my character design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads THEN the system SHALL display pre-configured color segments as subtle overlays
2. WHEN a visitor hovers over a color segment THEN the system SHALL highlight the segment with a visual indicator
3. WHEN hovering over segments THEN the system SHALL provide smooth hover transitions and effects
4. WHEN segments are displayed THEN the system SHALL make them discoverable without overwhelming the artwork
5. WHEN color segments are configured THEN the system SHALL accurately represent the colors from those specific areas

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see detailed color information when exploring the reference sheet, so that I can understand and potentially use the color palette.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor hovers over a color segment THEN the system SHALL display a color information panel
2. WHEN displaying color information THEN the system SHALL show the hex color code (e.g., #FF5733)
3. WHEN displaying color information THEN the system SHALL show RGB values (e.g., RGB(255, 87, 51))
4. WHEN displaying color information THEN the system SHALL show HSL values (e.g., HSL(12Â°, 100%, 60%))
5. WHEN the color panel appears THEN the system SHALL include a color swatch preview of the exact color

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the color information to be clearly visible and well-positioned, so that I can easily read the color details without obstruction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the color information panel appears THEN the system SHALL position it to avoid covering the reference sheet
2. WHEN displaying on the left or right side THEN the system SHALL choose the position with the most available space
3. WHEN the panel is shown THEN the system SHALL use high contrast colors for text readability
4. WHEN hovering ends THEN the system SHALL smoothly hide the color information panel
5. WHEN multiple segments are close together THEN the system SHALL prevent panel overlap or flickering

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want the site to work well on all devices, so that visitors can explore my character reference sheet whether they're on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL support touch interactions for color segments
2. WHEN the screen size is small THEN the system SHALL adjust the color panel positioning appropriately
3. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide tap-to-view functionality as an alternative to hover
4. WHEN on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain the reference sheet's visibility and interaction quality
5. WHEN the site loads on any device THEN the system SHALL be fully functional within 2 seconds

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to easily configure the color segments during development, so that I can accurately map the colors from my reference sheet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up color segments THEN the system SHALL allow configuration through a simple data structure
2. WHEN defining segments THEN the system SHALL support specifying coordinates, size, and associated color values
3. WHEN configuring colors THEN the system SHALL allow manual specification of hex, RGB, and HSL values
4. WHEN segments are defined THEN the system SHALL validate that coordinates fall within the image boundaries
5. WHEN color data is configured THEN the system SHALL ensure all required color format values are present
